# The Eloquence Paradox
After everything has become quiet, when the evening is old but the night has yet to drape its dark shroud around the world, I sit looking at the blinking caret. I dream of the epic, poetic words I might cast into the ether, but I hesitate. It is not that I am yearning for an audience; my words are a shout into the void, intended for the mindless crawlers of the internet rather than any human soul. But rather, my eloquence is a mere affectation. Ingesting the words of giants who kept me awake until the break of dawn has given me the taste for brilliance, but it has not granted me the power to produce it.

> I am a connoisseur of the epic, yet a practitioner of the mundane.

Since my early teenage years, I have devoured the works of the epic fantasy giants. In retrospect, some of those worlds have lost their luster, their flaws becoming visible under the lens of adulthood. Others, however, still hold me in a viced grip, their prose as sharp and immersive as the day I first discovered them.

As the years passed, the format changed even as the obsession remained. Gone were the days of crumbling paperbacks; instead, the stories began to live through the cadence of virtuosos. These masters of the spoken word gave a new, physical weight to the text. They bridged the gap for a reader who might stumble over the prose internally, allowing the intended story to bloom exactly as the author had imagined it.

As I absorb the diction of my muses, I have come to yearn for their mastery, that rare ability to seize the reader’s heart and squeeze until it finally, painfully feels; to manifest an inner world where fantastical beings take flight in the imagination of the reader. But alas, just because I can consume does not endow me with the eloquence nor the depths of oceans that my muses possess. To ingest brilliance is not to possess it; my own attempts remain insubstantial, a collection of shadows where there should be light.

Still, the impulse persists. I have come to realize that my toils are not for naught; there is a quiet, defiant joy in creating without the suffocating weight of an audience. By shouting into the void, I am granted leniency for my shortcomings. I am a graffiti artist of the Ether, filling the forgotten walls of cyberspace with my digital defacement, finding peace in the knowledge that they leave no meaningful impact.

There is a singular satisfaction in the act of creation. Not for the sake of consumption, but for the necessity of manifesting the restless dialogue of the mind.

This will be my Opus, my Sistine Chapel or my Titanic downfall, born from the hubris of walking along the valley of giants. Either way, the end game is not to do anything other than writing down matter onto the Ether for my brain to feel some semblance of satisfaction.
