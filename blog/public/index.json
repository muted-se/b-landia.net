I dream of the epic, poetic words I might cast into the ether, but I hesitate. It is not that I am yearning for an audience; my words are a shout into the void, intended for the mindless crawlers of the internet rather than any human soul. But rather, my eloquence is a mere affectation. Ingesting the words of giants who kept me awake until the break of dawn has given me the taste for brilliance, but it has not granted me the power to produce it.\nI am a connoisseur of the epic, yet a practitioner of the mundane.\nSince my early teenage years, I have devoured the works of the epic fantasy giants. In retrospect, some of those worlds have lost their luster, their flaws becoming visible under the lens of adulthood. Others, however, still hold me in a viced grip, their prose as sharp and immersive as the day I first discovered them.\nAs the years passed, the format changed even as the obsession remained. Gone were the days of crumbling paperbacks; instead, the stories began to live through the cadence of virtuosos. These masters of the spoken word gave a new, physical weight to the text. They bridged the gap for a reader who might stumble over the prose internally, allowing the intended story to bloom exactly as the author had imagined it.\nAs I absorb the diction of my muses, I have come to yearn for their mastery, that rare ability to seize the reader’s heart and squeeze until it finally, painfully feels; to manifest an inner world where fantastical beings take flight in the imagination of the reader. But alas, just because I can consume does not endow me with the eloquence nor the depths of oceans that my muses possess. To ingest brilliance is not to possess it; my own attempts remain insubstantial, a collection of shadows where there should be light.\nStill, the impulse persists. I have come to realize that my toils are not for naught; there is a quiet, defiant joy in creating without the suffocating weight of an audience. By shouting into the void, I am granted leniency for my shortcomings. I am a graffiti artist of the Ether, filling the forgotten walls of cyberspace with my digital defacement, finding peace in the knowledge that they leave no meaningful impact.\nThere is a singular satisfaction in the act of creation. Not for the sake of consumption, but for the necessity of manifesting the restless dialogue of the mind.\nThis will be my Opus, my Sistine Chapel or my Titanic downfall, born from the hubris of walking along the valley of giants. Either way, the end game is not to do anything other than writing down matter onto the Ether for my brain to feel some semblance of satisfaction.\n","date":"19 December 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-eloquence-paradox/","section":"","summary":"Sometimes I wish I was a epic fantasy author but I cannot write myself out of a weat bag.","title":"The Eloquence Paradox","type":"posts"},{"content":"A while ago there was a strange thing occurring with the CentOS project, for some reason they changed their planned end-of-life date for their release of CentOS 8. Since many utilised this as their main Operating System many butts where hurt and there was much gnashing of teeth. You, dear reader, should not forget that they were complaining about the fact that a free (as in beer) resource were being taken away from them. This was of course a move that Redhat made attempting to make freeloaders buy licenses for their Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS did not leave anyone hanging though but instead of the slow cadence of CentOS they now provide CentOS stream which is a rolling release (IE no 8.1, 8.2 and so on).\nI know this is a bit of an history lesson but I will get to the point of why I think it is good to get rug-pulled every so often within the field of IT.\nThe issue with removing a stable release in lieu of a rolling release # Many built their applications upon the versioned releases, which did make them come to a grinding halt when suddenly the target OS had no versioning locks and thus became that much harder to support. Others had come to expect that CentOS releases would keep for eight years and be the bastion of the data-center. Maybe the worst was for those who had started the sometimes complex and cumbersome task of moving onto the already released CentOS 8.1.\nOthers step forward to fill the void # Luckily there were others who stepped forward; SUSE for instance and Oracle among others. Scrambling for the confused and scared masses who Redhat just abandoned. Although Oracle is mentioned here more ironically than anything else. If the risk is vendor lock-in they should be feared since they are known to be very aggressive on this front. Either way some good alternatives are available, such as Debian, Rocky Linux and Redhat RHEL (which released free licenses for developers).\nSo in what way is the rug-pulling a positive? # Since I do a lot of lurking in the IRC channel it is quite obvious that people have a tendency to keep the status quo unless forced to change. Some ask for support on outdated or even unsupported versions of the operating system. Many do not even dare to upgrade their infrastructure because “it might break”. This indicates a failure of the people not the product. If your application is written so that you have no other choice then utilise a plus four year old version of an operating system then your money might have been better spent elsewhere. I am not excusing what Redhat did here, they (or the CentOS board) had made a promise to support l CentOS 8.X until end of 2029. My point here is that we are now forced to a steady renewal of our baseline operating system. If you have not had the foresight of having a testing environment now is a good time to set something up. CICD is not only for developers but for everyone and there are several good products out there that can assist in getting started with some type of automation. Proxmox VE for free virtualization (Debian), Ansible for configuration management and Jenkins for pipelines just to name a few. There will be more guides on how to get started with automation and testing of infrastructure in the future. In the end it is a positive that change is being forced upon any holdouts. The older ways are dying faster and faster and with the dawn of the LLM this has been accelerated ever further.\nRedhat then decided to further complicate the situation # Redhat (IBM) has figured they should further complicate their relationship with their community. By preventing the likes of Alma/Rocky/Oracle to use their sources as a way to repackage as their own. The way they opted to go was to move the source code behind a end user license agreement, so only paying customers and partners have access to the source code. A whole lot of bricks were shat this time.\nSo what? # This time it is a bit harder to actually defend the actions taken, they are not following the spirit of Open Source licensing but rather the letter. By moving the source code away from any public repository and allowing for only signed up entities they very efficiently close down this avenue to repackage the full release. This has been very well written up by several smart individuals so please read/listen to what their thoughts are on this.\nSo why is this a bigger issue then the rug-pull? # This time it is rather bad, not only did they perform a penile move but they also did just lock away many future potential users for some short-sighted gains. To exemplify I have been a hardcore CentOS user, when I started working in enterprise environments the effort to working with a RHEL server was near zero. But for all new system administrators, developers and enthusiasts there is no options left. So instead the next generations will be using other distributions.\nWhat are the alternatives # So clearly there is now many caveats with utilising any code released by Redhat that is not directly licensed by them to you. There is still the developer license available but if they can yank a fully working distribution mid-cycle they can change those terms at a moments notice.\nIn the future I will migrate over to Debian fully, but due to the sheer amount of time put into the Ansible automation I currently sport it is a long time before I will be able to make the switch. Debian is not only a strong community driven distribution, it is also not as susceptible to being overtaken like CentOS proved to be. There are other alternatives with similar community driven projects like archlinux and voidlinux to name two. For servers some stability is required so the above might be fun to use on the desktop but not for hosting applications. My main line of thought is to keep away from any company owned distribution (like Ubuntu, Oracle Linux and SUSE).\n","date":"1 July 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/the-question/","section":"","summary":"What is the best way to survive when the long-term becomes short-term","title":"To be or to not be","type":"posts"},{"content":"While some might think that creating anything more then the one root partition is unnecessarily obscure or obtuse, for me, a Linux installation is not complete without a carefully planned partition scheme. The benefits are several, first and foremost you protect yourself against a single stupid application logging to much and filling your entire drive with some spammed syslog message. Secondly there is some security benefits since you can deny specific actions from being available to a unprivileged user in the system via others writable areas. It also simplifies restoration when a system has had failures,or as in my case: I have yet again reinstalled the Operating system and need to now dump all my stuff back into the /home/ directories.\nThe method we will use is to now break down the what and slowly work our way to the why and in the end we might end up understanding my train of thoughts in respect to why having several mount-points is a good thing.\nWhat # In most modern Desktop and Server Linux distributions today you will be allowed to partition your disk during installation, this is in essence a way to logically divide a hard-drive into smaller pieces with more narrow purposes. This allows us to split out the /home path so that it does not share storage with /var/log for instance. Using tools like fdisk you can both list and manipulate the partition table written to the early blocks of your storage medium. But since this is not 1990 you can also use more modern tooling such as LVM (or utilize cool filesystems like ZFS or BTRFS) to instead create a virtual partition scheme. This is helpful since a GPT or even MBR is not really flexible (you will still have a GPT scheme just that you will have only two or three partitions for /boot, /boot/efi and for the LVM).\nBut wait! You think; this matters little on a laptop since the underlying drive will not change.\nThis is a correct thought to have but there is not really a good reason to overly allocate storage space either. A modest setup can get by with a very small footprint and the only real storage requirements might be the /home partition.\nWe will use my current laptop as a example of how it could be:\nNAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS nvme0n1 259:0 0 238.5G 0 disk └─nvme0n1p1 259:1 0 238.5G 0 part └─luks-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 253:0 0 238.5G 0 crypt ├─vg0-root 253:1 0 8G 0 lvm / ├─vg0-swap 253:2 0 4G 0 lvm [SWAP] ├─vg0-usr 253:3 0 16G 0 lvm /usr ├─vg0-var_lib_flatpak 253:4 0 16G 0 lvm /var/lib/flatpak ├─vg0-var_log_audit 253:5 0 1G 0 lvm /var/log/audit ├─vg0-var 253:6 0 4G 0 lvm /var ├─vg0-tmp 253:7 0 4G 0 lvm /tmp ├─vg0-var_log 253:8 0 1G 0 lvm /var/log ├─vg0-var_cache 253:9 0 4G 0 lvm /var/cache └─vg0-var_tmp 253:10 0 4G 0 lvm /var/tmp nvme1n1 259:2 0 931.5G 0 disk ├─nvme1n1p1 259:3 0 1G 0 part /boot/efi ├─nvme1n1p2 259:4 0 1G 0 part /boot └─nvme1n1p3 259:5 0 929.5G 0 part └─luks-00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 253:11 0 929.5G 0 crypt ├─vg1-opt 253:12 0 32G 0 lvm /opt └─vg1-home 253:13 0 512G 0 lvm /home Note here that I have two separate NVME drives (nvme0n1 and nvme1n1) which are used for Operating system related storage and storage for my personal data. Furthermore the above lsblk output tells us that I have a Encrypted partition and some un-encrypted partitions. This is what is called \u0026ldquo;encrypted LVM\u0026rdquo; which is basically three partitions, one for /boot (nvme1n1p1), one for /boot/efi (nvme1n1p2) and a third for a LUKS encrypted partition (nvme1n1p3) containing a Logical Volume Group.\nWe can summarise this saying that we have three old-school partitions and inside of the encrypted third partition we have a Logical Volume Group containing our actual Operating system and personal files. We can also see that there are several logical volumes in both a vg0 and vg1. Each mounted to a specific path in the Operating System (Flags always include defaults and noatime):\nPath Size Flags (fstab) Function / 8 GiB Root partition /usr 16 GiB System binaries and libraries /var/lib/flatpak 16 GiB nosuid,nodev System flatpak storage /var/log/audit 1 GiB nosuid,nodev,noexec Audit logs /var 4 GiB nosuid,nodev Variable data /var/log 1 GiB nosuid,nodev,noexec System logs (syslog) /var/cache 4 GiB nosuid,nodev,noexec Cached files /var/tmp 4 GiB nosuid,nodev,noexec Temporary Files /tmp 4 GiB nosuid,nodev,noexec Temporary Files /opt 32 GiB nosuid,nodev External packages Swap 4 GiB System SWAP space /home X GiB nosuid,nodev User files and binaries /dev/shm N/A nosuid,nodev,noexec Shared memory area /run N/A nosuid,nodev Runtime information /dev N/A nosuid,noexec Devices and pseudo devices /boot 1 GiB nosuid,nodev,noexec Boot files If you look back at the output from lsblk you can see that I have used the larger drive to be in a Logical Volume Group named vg1 and the smaller drive to be in vg0 which separates the user-data further from the system data. You can also see my mistake in having (somewhat illogically) the /boot and /boot/efi on the second drive ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.\nWhy separating mount-points is good practice? # As mentioned in the ingress there are two major reasons to actually do this, first being able to add noexec,nodev,nosuid to mount-points to protect against malicious actors, secondly to prevent either user-mistakes or run-away issues from eating up all disk-space for the entire machine.\nSecurity and compliance benefits # The scheme adds the ability to follow the principles of least privileges by restricting certain types of actions within critical mount-points from being available. It also acts as a initial barrier to any malicious actor that has managed to get a foot-hold on the machine from easily escalating their privileges. There is also the issue of most individuals not understanding that having just one big mount-point for root leaves them vulnerable and the guides and setup of most operating systems does not inform of the risk and potential benefits of utilising this type of schema to separate their mount-points. There is also some security/compliance standards that require this to be the case, not only because they like to be draconian but because it is a way of removing low-hanging fruits from any attackers.\nProtection against mistakes and dumb stuff # The other major benefit is that you are now protected from a single log-file growing due to random reasons and filling your drive up. It might sound innocent but on a database server this can be catastrophic when it occurs. This type of knowledge comes from experiencing getting a notification during on-call that the drive is full and the subsequent head-scratching and curses this leads to.\nRisks are also a thing here # One thing to keep in mind is that using a lean mount-point schema you also is at risk of having allocated to little. In my templates there is usually 40 GiB of allocated storage for the defaults. Due to the flexible nature of LVM this is usually not an issue but if you are a bit cheap and allow only 512 MiB for your /boot you might be in a world of hurt when it comes time to expand a actual GPT partition.\nIn conclusion # Using a somewhat over-complex/overcompensating partition and mount-point scheme brings many benefits and even if there are several draw-backs in the end having a basic hardening of the operating systems data-storage in place removes some of the venues that a attacker might utilise. This is not a guide since there are several things that requires consideration since the example here is for a Desktop rather then a Server. Still the complexity added is actually low unless you utilise Ubuntu since Canonical still leans on using partitions rather then LVM.\nI did also ask Google\u0026rsquo;s Gemini to fact-check me to ensure I am not just making things up as I go along;\nWhat reasons are there and what recommendations does exist for adding noexec,nodev or nosuid to mouint points in the FSTAB file in linux? Specify reasons for, what mount-points should have which flags and find good facts to back up this\nOkay, let\u0026rsquo;s break down the noexec, nodev, and nosuid mount options in Linux\u0026rsquo;s /etc/fstab file. These options are primarily used for security hardening by restricting potentially dangerous actions on specific filesystems.\nUnderstanding the Flags\nnosuid (No Set User ID)\nWhat it does: Prevents Set-User-ID (SUID) and Set-Group-ID (SGID) bits from taking effect on executables within the mounted filesystem. Normally, an executable with the SUID bit set runs with the privileges of the file\u0026rsquo;s owner (often root), not the user who executed it. SGID makes it run with the group privileges of the file\u0026rsquo;s group. Reason for use (Security): This is a crucial security measure to prevent privilege escalation. If an attacker compromises a user account and manages to place or modify a SUID/SGID binary (especially one owned by root) on a partition mounted without nosuid, they could execute it to gain elevated privileges (e.g., root access). Disabling SUID/SGID effectively neutralizes this common attack vector on partitions where users might have write access or where untrusted files could land. nodev (No Devices)\nWhat it does: Prevents the interpretation of character or block special device files on the mounted filesystem. Device files (like /dev/sda, /dev/random, /dev/mem) provide interfaces to hardware or kernel functions. Reason for use (Security): Creating or accessing device files requires specific privileges, but if an attacker could somehow create a malicious device file (e.g., one pointing to raw disk memory) on a partition mounted without nodev, they might be able to use it to bypass security controls, access sensitive data directly, or crash the system. This option prevents files on the partition from being treated as device interfaces. noexec (No Execute)\nWhat it does: Prevents the direct execution of binary executables residing on the mounted filesystem. The execute permission bits on files are ignored for binaries. Important Note: This often does not prevent the execution of scripts (like Shell, Python, Perl) if the interpreter itself resides on a partition mounted with execute permissions (e.g., /bin/bash, /usr/bin/python). You could still run sh /path/to/script.sh even if /path/to/ is on a noexec partition. However, it stops direct execution like ./myprogram. Reason for use (Security): This adds a layer of defense against malware execution. If an attacker manages to upload a malicious compiled program (binary) onto a partition mounted with noexec (like /tmp), they cannot directly run it from that location. They would need to move it to an executable partition first, which might be prevented by other controls. Recommendations: Which Flags on Which Mount Points?\nThe general principle is least privilege: a filesystem should only be mounted with the capabilities necessary for its intended purpose.\nHere are common recommendations, often found in security guides like the CIS Benchmarks:\n/tmp\nRecommended Flags: defaults,nosuid,nodev,noexec Rationale: /tmp is world-writable and designed for temporary files. It\u0026rsquo;s a prime target for attackers to store malicious scripts, binaries, device files, or SUID exploits. Disabling all three (nosuid, nodev, noexec) significantly hardens this volatile area. Legitimate applications generally don\u0026rsquo;t need to execute binaries directly from /tmp, create devices there, or rely on SUID files within it. Note: Some poorly written installers or applications might try to execute from /tmp, so noexec can occasionally cause compatibility issues, requiring investigation. /var/tmp\nRecommended Flags: defaults,nosuid,nodev,noexec Rationale: Similar to /tmp, but often persists across reboots. The same security concerns apply, making it a target for dropped malware or exploit tools. The same hardening flags are strongly recommended. /dev/shm (Shared Memory)\nRecommended Flags: defaults,nosuid,nodev,noexec Rationale: This is a tmpfs (RAM-based filesystem) used for POSIX shared memory. It\u0026rsquo;s typically used for Inter-Process Communication (IPC), not for storing regular executables, device files, or SUID programs. Applying these flags prevents potential misuse of this memory-backed filesystem. /home (If a separate partition)\nRecommended Flags: defaults,nodev,nosuid (noexec is often not recommended here) Rationale: nodev: Users should generally never need to create device files within their home directories. Enabling nodev prevents potential misuse. nosuid: Prevents users from introducing SUID/SGID binaries into their home directories (or having downloaded malware gain root via SUID if placed there). This is a significant security benefit on multi-user systems. noexec: This is controversial and often problematic for /home. Users often need to execute scripts or compile and run legitimate software within their home directories. Applying noexec breaks this common workflow and can cause major usability issues. It\u0026rsquo;s generally only used in very high-security, restricted environments. Removable Media (USB drives, external HDDs - often handled by udisks or automounters, not static fstab)\nRecommended Flags (if manually configured or via udev rules): noexec,nosuid,nodev,nofail,user (or users) Rationale: External media is inherently untrusted. It could contain malware, SUID exploits, or malicious device files. Applying all three restrictions significantly reduces the risk when mounting unknown devices. nofail prevents boot issues if the device isn\u0026rsquo;t present, and user/users allows regular users to mount/unmount. /boot (If a separate partition)\nRecommended Flags: defaults,nosuid,nodev,noexec (Optional but good practice) Rationale: Contains the kernel, initramfs, and bootloader config. No execution, device files, or SUID binaries should ever be needed here during normal operation. Adding these flags adds a minor layer of integrity protection, although write access is usually restricted to root anyway. /, /usr, /var (excluding /var/tmp), /opt\nRecommended Flags: defaults (Generally do not add noexec, nodev, nosuid) Rationale: These partitions contain the core operating system, essential system binaries (many requiring exec), libraries, potentially legitimate SUID binaries (like passwd, sudo, ping), and system data. Applying noexec or nosuid here would break the system fundamentally. nodev is usually unnecessary as device creation is typically restricted to /dev. Facts and Justification\nDefense in Depth: These options provide additional security layers. Even if one control fails (e.g., an application vulnerability allows file upload), noexec or nosuid might prevent the subsequent exploitation or privilege escalation step. Principle of Least Privilege: Filesystems should only grant the minimum necessary permissions. If execution isn\u0026rsquo;t needed (/tmp), don\u0026rsquo;t allow it. If device nodes aren\u0026rsquo;t needed (/home), disable them. Compliance and Benchmarks: Security standards like the CIS (Center for Internet Security) Benchmarks for various Linux distributions explicitly recommend using nosuid, nodev, and noexec on partitions like /tmp, /var/tmp, and /dev/shm. They often recommend nodev and nosuid for /home as well. Following these benchmarks is common practice in security-conscious environments. Preventing Common Attack Vectors: Exploits often rely on writing to world-writable areas like /tmp and then executing code or using SUID binaries from there. These flags directly counter such common techniques.
